# dzd-currency
The exchange rate of the Algerian currency vs USD-EUR-GBP API Service

DZD-Currency is an express js api service that helps people to get real-time currency rate change in JSON format.
The principle of this application is loading html content from the official website of the Algerian Central Bank or CPA Bank and retrive the a json format.

## The aim of converting this application
As a software engineer who had missions to develop business application for some Algerian companies, we always had a problem when it comes to getting the DZD-USD/ DZD-EUR change rates specially that there is no official API service from the Algerian Government

## Note:
Please note that this code could useless or deprecated in case when the Algerian Central Bank / CPA banks have decided to update their website
